abstract = {The early stages of type 1 diabetes (T1D) are characterized by local autoimmune inflammation and progressive loss of insulin-producing pancreatic $\beta$ cells. Here we show that exposure to proinflammatory cytokines reveals a marked plasticity of the $\beta$-cell regulatory landscape. We expand the repertoire of human islet regulatory elements by mapping stimulus-responsive enhancers linked to changes in the $\beta$-cell transcriptome, proteome and three-dimensional chromatin structure. Our data indicate that the $\beta$-cell response to cytokines is mediated by the induction of new regulatory regions as well as the activation of primed regulatory elements prebound by islet-specific transcription factors. We find that T1D-associated loci are enriched with newly mapped cis-regulatory regions and identify T1D-associated variants disrupting cytokine-responsive enhancer activity in human $\beta$ cells. Our study illustrates how $\beta$ cells respond to a proinflammatory environment and implicate a role for stimulus response islet enhancers in T1D.},

abstract = {We developed a targeted chromosome conformation capture (4C) approach that uses unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to derive high-complexity quantitative chromosome contact profiles with controlled signal-to-noise ratios. UMI-4C detects chromosomal interactions with improved sensitivity and specificity, and it can easily be multiplexed to allow robust comparison of contact distributions between loci and conditions. This approach may open the way to the incorporation of contact distributions into quantitative models of gene regulation.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Circularized Chromosome Conformation Capture (4C) is a powerful technique for studying the spatial interactions of a specific genomic region called the ‘viewpoint’ with the rest of the genome, both in a single condition or comparing different experimental conditions or cell types. Observed ligation frequencies typically show a strong, regular dependence on genomic distance from the viewpoint, on top of which specific interaction peaks are superimposed. Here, we address the computational task to find these specific peaks and to detect changes between different biological conditions.Results: We model the overall trend of decreasing interaction frequency with genomic distance by fitting a smooth monotonically decreasing function to suitably transformed count data. Based on the fit, z-scores are calculated from the residuals, and high z-scores are interpreted as peaks providing evidence for specific interactions. To compare different conditions, we normalize fragment counts between samples, and call for differential contact frequencies using the statistical method {DESeq}2 adapted from {RNA}-Seq analysis.Availability and implementation: A full end-to-end analysis pipeline is implemented in the R package {FourCSeq} available at www.bioconductor.org.Contact:felix.klein@embl.de or whuber@embl.{deSupplementary} information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in {RNA}-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present {DESeq}2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The {DESeq}2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/{DESeq}2.html.},
